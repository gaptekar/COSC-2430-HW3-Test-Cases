# Test Cases for Homework 3


I made these test cases because the TA's haven't given us any yet.

I verified all answers by writing a script in python, which I also included.
It took my program about 4 seconds to run through the first file and less than 1 second for the other file.

# How to Run
Markup : 
 * Click the green "Clone or download" button
 * Click download zip
 * Put either your hw3.exe or all your c++ files in the folder
 * Run: sh ./testall.sh
 * Look in the differences folder if you failed any
 * If you keep timing out on random_tests.txt don't worry about it. It's 200 times larger than the max input file
